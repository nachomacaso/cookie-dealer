      <p class="about-me">
      Growing up I was a little fat kid <br>
      and I ate just about everything. <br> 
      With my culinary influences being <br>
      my italian mother and grandmother, <br>
      it's no wonder that I became a Chef. <br> 
      Now after 20 years in the business <br>
      I've decided to take my passion for <br>
      food and turn it into my own business. <br> 
      Allow me to introduce myselft to you <br> 
      dear reader, I am your new <br>
      Cookie Dealer ... </p>
